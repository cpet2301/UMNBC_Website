###Set up
1. Fork the repo or git pull the andysbranch
2. npm init
3. create a .env file in the server folder (dm me on discord and i'll send you api keys)
4. run the backend by doing into the src folder and doing npm start
5. run the front end by going into the src folder and doing run run dev

##src folder
1. if youre in the UMNBC_Website_Fork directory
    - check by doing pwd in terminal
    - cd .. (this moves you a folder back/out)
    - cd [[folder-name]] (this moves you into the folder)
    - npm start (once you are in the src folder. So ex in terminal: cd src)

##server folder
    - npm run dev (once you are in the server folder)

## If you need help with cd and terminal
